We strugged to get things working. Essentially, we followed what you had in your instructions and, in attempting to get the emulator online, killed the server and started it again. However, this did not work and we were unable to produce results with our code. On the other hand, our code did compile and produced no errors. We are confident that the code should work but due to the emulator situation we could not prove that. Molli spent the most time on this project, multiple hours for the passed three days. I attempted to help but it's difficult to assist since it's on her machine and simply strictly following instructions. However, when we got towards the end of it, I was able to assist some by googling how to do certain things. It is rather difficult to understand why specific issues were happening. One of the major ones being the emulator didn't come online. Unfortunately, we were unable to produce the screenshots that were requested.
